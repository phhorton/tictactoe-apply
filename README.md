# tictactoe-apply

I used the Spring Tool Suite 4 text editor to create this program as a Maven project and the Apache Tomcat v9.0 Server to run the program.  The TicTacToe folder will contain the Java code used to run the program and the Servers folder contains the server that this program can run on.
To run this program, you will need to run the server (the server will run on localhost and use port 9912) and then go to the URL http://localhost:9912/TicTacToe/game to start the first Tic Tac Toe game.  Afterwards, all you need to do is enter a value into the input box at the bottom to proceed.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
